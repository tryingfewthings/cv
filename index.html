    Here you can find some of my Education
    <ul>
        <li>2013-2017<br>
        Psychology in <em> <a href="https://www.ub.edu/web/portal/ca/"> Universitat de Barcelona </a> </em> <br>
        I loved the degree and the last year of it I decided specialize in HR. I got my first experience in HR, working as a Recruiter
            Trainee in the HR department in <em><a href="https://www.clinicbarcelona.org/"> Hospital Cl√≠nic </a> </em> </li>
        <li>2019<br>
            Big Data Anlyitcs in <em> <a href="https://www.salleurl.edu/es"> La Salle - Ramon Llul </a> </em> <br>
            I liked that course, but it was for only one month (it was a pretty intense month), I get a lot of information with this course, but
            I didn't have the tools to manage them, and to create a change in my work environment<br>
        </li>
        <li>
            2020<br>
            During the pandemic I did a lot of courses in coursera, most of them about HR and leadership as <em>IESE - Claves para Gestionar Personas</em>
            or <em>International Leadership and Organizational Behavior</em>
        </li>
